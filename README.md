# Node Auth 2 Guided Project

## Take Aways
* tokens vs sessions, sessions 
  * sessions --> look up the value - takes longer
  * tokens can be validated by the server just looking at it, no lookup
  * drawbacks - jtw not the best solution for authentication
  * created an env for jwt secret password and incorporated it to user router and middleware
